### Assignment Overview

You are making a shopping list to take the store so you can bake your favorite dessert.

You're pretty sure you remembered to add all of required the ingredients, but something doesn't look quite right. 

Let's try printing the ingredients out a few different ways to see if we can spot the issue.


Follow the instructions in `baking.py` to get cooking.
